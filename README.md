### Personal Projects

As you can see from my pinned projects, most of the work I do on GitHub is under different organizations, primarily
[Deep-Symmetry](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry). What you’ll find under my own profile is largely forks to contribute
to other dependencies, experimental projects not polished enough for wide use, and exercises like solutions for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

One possible exception is [shade](https://github.com/brunchboy/shade), the fancy controller software I created for
our automated blinds at home. If you happen to have compatible blinds and are willing to set up a server, take photos,
and configure the database to allow similar magic at home, it’s ready for you.
